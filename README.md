# Plugfy.Core.Data.Communication.STDInOut

## Overview
The **STDInOut** extension of the Plugfy Core Data Communication module offers a straightforward and efficient method for handling data communication through standard input/output channels. This extension is designed to facilitate inter-component communication within applications by utilizing the most basic form of inter-process communication provided by the operating system.

---

## Features
- **Simple Integration**: Easily integrates into any .NET application that requires inter-process communication via standard console inputs and outputs.
- **Lightweight Communication Protocol**: Utilizes simple JSON serialization for data transfer, making it both lightweight and easy to implement.
- **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: Works across different operating systems where the .NET runtime is supported, providing a universal solution for console-based data communication.
- **Asynchronous Communication Support**: Supports asynchronous operations to enhance performance and responsiveness in applications.

## Installation
To integrate the SSTDInOut Communication Extension into your project, follow these steps:
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Include the project in your solution or reference the built assembly directly.
3. Ensure your project targets .NET Framework 8 or higher.
---

## Usage
To implement the STDInOut communication extension in your project, create an instance of the `STDInOut` class and use it to send or receive messages. Initialize the communication with required configurations, if any.

Example:
```csharp
var stdInOut = new STDInOut();
await stdInOut.InitializeAsync(null); // Initialize without specific configuration
await stdInOut.StartListeningAsync();  // Start listening for incoming data

// Sending data
await stdInOut.SendDataAsync(new { Message = "Hello, World!" });
```
